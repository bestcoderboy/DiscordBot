# TLEWikiBot
## Getting started
To host the TLEWikiBot locally, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary packages.
Then create a `.env` file and put your discord token inside like this:
`DISCORD_TOKEN=<YOUR-TOKEN-HERE>`
Finally, run `python main.py` to run the script and start the bot.
